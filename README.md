# Employment Equity: An Analysis of Distribution of Salary Ranges of Public Service of Canada Employees


## About
This repository contains code to visualize  employee salary data from the Government of Canada's Treasury Board, [publically available here](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/human-resources-statistics/diversity-inclusion-statistics.html). A webpage with outputs and finding can be found [here](index).

## The Data
This data is based on self identification of equity-deserving groups, and represents pre-tax salary ranges excluding bonuses and promotions. In order to obtain the data, the webpage was scraped with the R package `rvest`. Then, `dplyr` and `tidyr` were used to clean it up and plotting was done with `ggplot` and `plotly`.
